# Deploy to Production

This skill commits all pending changes, pushes to `main`, monitors CI pipelines, fixes any failures, and deploys to production once everything is green.

**CRITICAL:** This is a destructive, externally-visible action. Confirm each major step with the user before proceeding.

---

## Step 1: Commit & Push

1. Run `git status` and `git diff` to review all pending changes.
2. Present a summary of changes to the user and draft a commit message.
3. Stage relevant files (never stage `.env`, credentials, or secrets).
4. Commit with the drafted message (get user approval on the message first).
5. Push to `main`. The pre-push hook (`npm run test:run`) will run automatically.
6. If pre-push tests fail:
   - Analyze the failure output.
   - Fix the root cause (do not skip hooks with `--no-verify`).
   - Re-commit the fix and push again.
   - Repeat until push succeeds.

## Step 2: Monitor CI

After a successful push, two CI workflows run automatically on `main`:

| Workflow | File | What it checks |
|----------|------|----------------|
| **Main Branch CI** | `main-ci.yml` | Type-check, lint, format, unit tests, build, E2E (Chromium + Firefox) |
| **Security Scanning** | `security.yml` | npm audit, SAST, secrets detection, CodeQL |

Monitor both workflows:

1. Wait ~30 seconds after push, then check workflow status:
   ```
   gh run list --workflow=main-ci.yml --branch=main --limit=1
   gh run list --workflow=security.yml --branch=main --limit=1
   ```
2. Poll every 30 seconds until both complete:
   ```
   gh run watch <run-id>
   ```
3. If a workflow **fails**:
   - Fetch the failed job logs: `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`
   - Analyze the error and fix the root cause.
   - Commit the fix, push, and restart monitoring from the beginning of Step 2.
   - Maximum 3 fix attempts. If still failing after 3 rounds, stop and report the issue to the user.
4. If both workflows pass, proceed to Step 3.

## Step 3: Deploy

Once both CI and Security workflows show green:

1. Confirm with the user: "CI and Security are green. Ready to deploy to production?"
2. Only after explicit user approval, trigger the deploy:
   ```
   gh workflow run deploy.yml
   ```
3. Monitor the deploy workflow:
   ```
   gh run list --workflow=deploy.yml --limit=1
   gh run watch <run-id>
   ```
4. The deploy workflow has its own gate that re-verifies CI/Security passed for the commit.
5. If deploy fails, fetch logs and report to the user. Do not retry automatically.
6. On success, report: deployed commit SHA, deploy duration, and the production URL.

## GitHub Account

This repo requires the **`gparker97`** GitHub account.

Before pushing or triggering workflows, verify the active account:
```
gh auth status
```

If a different account is authorized, switch first:
```
gh auth switch --user gparker97
```

If `gparker97` is not logged in at all, prompt the user to authenticate:
```
gh auth login
```

## Rules

- **Never use `--no-verify` or `--force`** on any git command.
- **Never skip or silence CI failures** — always fix the root cause.
- **Never trigger `deploy.yml` without explicit user confirmation** that CI is green.
- **Never amend published commits** — always create new fix commits.
- **Stop and ask the user** if anything unexpected happens (merge conflicts, unknown failures, flaky tests).
- The deploy workflow name is exactly `deploy.yml` (display name: "Deploy beanies PROD").
